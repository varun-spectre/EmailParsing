# EmailParsing

# Objective
Extracting "From Address" ,"Subject" and "Body" fields from the .eml file 
# Usecase
In many banking sectors or any telecom sectors, user will send a mail to customer care services stating his problems or queries. 
I wanted to create a virtualbot which processes user queries in email.

It is a simple python script which extracts user email ID , subject and body from .eml file
you can download a email as .eml file.
